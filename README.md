## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first Responsive Design
- [JavaScript](https://javascript.info) - Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I learned how to create a dropdown sub-menu using a vanilla CSS.

### Continued development

I will continue learning about positioning background image as I am still not fully comfortable with this concept.

### Useful resources

- [Bold on hover](https://css-tricks.com/bold-on-hover-without-the-layout-shift/) - This article helped me fix my anchor tag issue.
- [pseudo-element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements) - I'd recommend it to anyone to learn and understand the pseudo-element concept as it's very beneficial.
